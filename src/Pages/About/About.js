                Hopped-Up Gaming: East is a beer and gaming podcast originating
                from Halifax Nova Scotia. It started as a bunch of guys that
                wanted to sit around, drink a few beers and talk about video
                games but has since evolved into a more full featured podcast
                with expertly crafted beer critique. Not really. But it’s a lot
                of fun.

                Over the last 8 years HUGE (fun acronym right?) has grown and
                shifted to cover more than just video games. Listen to any
                episode today and you’ll likely hear about board games, card
                games, movies, pop culture and of course we still talk about
                craft beer and video games.
