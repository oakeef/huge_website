Here are some of the projects we are most proud of:

- **XCOMMITEE**: An interesting take on playing the strategy game XCOM. We have one save file and pass it around for 1 hour turns and meet up at the end of each round and talk about what happened. Basically playing XCOM by Commitee.

   *Season 1* (3/23/15 - 6/15/15) covers the events of XCOM Enemy Unkown and Enemy Within Expansion.  
   *Season 2* (8/29/17 - 8/22/18) covers the events of XCOM 2, Alien Hunters and War of the Chosen Expansion.  
   You can find both Seasons on the [XCOMMITEE Itunes Page](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/x-committee/id979571952?mt=2)
- **Beer Goggles**: A fun little experiment where one of the HUGE members picks a game they remember loving from their childhood and grabbing another HUGE member as a co-pilot to play through the game in it's entiretly and see if they still love it or if it was just nostalgia. Hence the name _Beer Googles_. 

   You can check it out on the [HUGE Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUe059UenoPXUNfHyj6Esqw).
- **Live Streaming**: We have done a few 12 and 24 hour charity livestreams in support of the IWK and Childsplay. You can find archives of those on the [HUGE Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUe059UenoPXUNfHyj6Esqw).
