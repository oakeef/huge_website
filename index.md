  **Hopped-Up Gaming: East** is a beer and gaming podcast originating from Halifax Nova Scotia.
It started as a bunch of guys that wanted to sit around, drink a few beers and talk about video games but has since evolved into a more full featured podcast with expertly crafted beer critique. Not really. But it's a lot of fun.

Over the last 8 years HUGE (fun acronym right?) has grown and shifted to cover more than just video games. Listen to any episode today and you'll likely hear about board games, card games, movies, pop culture and of course we still talk about craft beer and video games.
