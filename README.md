## Description

Hopped-Up Gaming: East (HUGE) is a beer and gaming podcast originating from Halifax Nova Scotia. It started as a bunch of guys that wanted to sit around, drink a few beers and talk about video games but has since evolved into a more full featured podcast with expertly crafted beer critique. Not really. But itâ€™s a lot of fun.

The site was built with React JS and hosted on Netlify, which also handles the contact form submissions.
